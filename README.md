# Anomaly investigation

Trilepton selection has particular 2b region where invariant mass of the same flavour lepton pair creates a peak.
The conventional methods to investigate the origin have been resultless. The idea is to build NN model using all possible properties as an input features, and rank which of them point to the highest separation between two classes in the peak region.
